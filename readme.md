## TODO

Authentication via firebase
 - Auth
 - Persisting sessions
 - Permissioned Access - encrypted Auth header into the API for all API requests


Blockchain backup
 - Save copy of the current blockchain if all nodes go down
 - Download the whole blockchain as JSON
 - Reload blockchain in memory using an existing downloaded JSON file

Visuals
 - Show the mining process in realtime

Redux
 - State persistence throughout app

SPA
 - Consolidate into single page application. I don't think I really need routes for anything. I will leave the structure for now.
